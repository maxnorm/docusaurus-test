<Callout type="info" title="Learning Path">
We recommend starting with **Facets & Libraries** to understand the core architecture, then moving to **Storage Patterns** to see how it all works together.
</Callout>

## Why These Matter

The concepts in this section form the foundation of everything you'll build with Compose:

- **Authentication** ensures your contracts have proper access control
- **Facets & Libraries** explain how to structure your code
- **Diamond Standard** provides the underlying architecture
- **Storage Patterns** enable the shared state that makes it all work

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Don't rush through these concepts. Taking time to understand the foundations will make everything else much easier and prevent common mistakes.
