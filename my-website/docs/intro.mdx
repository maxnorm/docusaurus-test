## What is Compose?

**Compose** is a revolutionary smart contract library that helps developers create sophisticated smart contract systems using the **ERC-2535 Diamond** standard. It's designed from the ground up to prioritize code readability, on-chain composability, and developer understanding.

### The Vision

Imagine having access to a comprehensive, verified standard library of smart contract components that you can combine like LEGO blocks to build complex systems—all deployed once on-chain and reused across your projects. That's Compose.

## Key Features

## How It Works

Compose uses a **shared storage architecture** where both standard facets and your custom facets access the same data:

```solidity
// Your custom facet integrates with Compose using libraries
import {LibERC721} from "compose/LibERC721.sol";

contract GameNFTFacet {
    function mintWithGameLogic(address player, uint256 tokenId) external {
        // Your custom game logic
        require(playerHasEnoughPoints(player), "Not enough points");
        
        // Use LibERC721 to mint - this modifies the SAME storage
        // that ERC721Facet uses for balanceOf(), ownerOf(), etc.
        LibERC721.mint(player, tokenId);
        
        // Now the player owns this NFT and can use standard
        // ERC721Facet.transferFrom() to transfer it!
        updatePlayerStats(player);
    }
}
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Key Insight">
Both your `GameNFTFacet` and the standard `ERC721Facet` work with the **same storage** in your diamond. This is the power of Compose's shared storage architecture.
</Callout>
